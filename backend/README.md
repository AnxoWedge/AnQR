# QR Code Generator 

This is a little experiment of mine in trying to make a new QR Code Generator. This will be used for various events, brands and other usages in order to have a free version qrcode, that let's me do QRcodes without the strings attached that some options online have. 

## Requirements 

This App is being developed with the following tech stack currently: 
- Python 3.11
- pip and venv
- qrcode
- Pillow

## What is planned

Things planned in adding: 
- Functions from Pillow to add customization to QRCode 
- A terminal-based interaction for the app
- Will have an UI and Front-end for interaction like a webapp 
- Maybe a creation of an AI for a AI-Based customized QRcode

This will include the following tech for the completion of these current objections: 
- Flask
- A React or Nextjs page / Astro
- Either PyTorch, Tensorflow, or brain.js
